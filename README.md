# Message Board Backend

## The task

Please build a production ready Node.JS application that works like a simple message board. This app should expose a REST interface that allows an anonymous user to submit messages and to retrieve a list of the submitted messages. Please follow sound engineering practices and due to the limited time available, please document any trade-offs that you had to make whilst building this app.
